# rbst328
Binary Search Tree implementation in Rust. For fun and to practice Rust programming.

The plan is as follows:

1) Have a working BST implementation
2) Add Red-Black tree functionality to make it balanced
3) Add serialization and deserialization from/to bytes
4) Try sending it over a network, writing to a file or some other way of IPC/data sync
